ABOUT MONEY TREE
=========================
Catch falling leaves to grow your own Money Tree!  Help William the gardener win over the beautiful Elizabeth Grant by growing the mysterious tree in his yard.  Plant leaves, monitor the weather and harvest fruit to earn enough cash to win Elizabeth’s affections.  
 
 
HOW TO PLAY
=========================
Catch leaves as they fall from the sky, and attach them to the leaf buds. When you attach leaves to all the buds on a branch, it will begin to grow. After some time, the tree will bloom, and fruit will begin to grow. You earn money by picking the fruit from the tree or by catching it as it falls to the ground. In each level, you will have to collect a certain amount of money before time runs out. Remember to watch out for weather changes! The thermometer and water meter will display the weather conditions, and it’s up to you to regulate them for the health of your tree. You can regulate the weather by using the sprinkler and the heating lamp. Watch out for pests because they will eat your fruit. Don’t forget to buy bug spray! Also, you can decorate your garden with different upgrades so that Elizabeth will like your garden when she comes to visit.
